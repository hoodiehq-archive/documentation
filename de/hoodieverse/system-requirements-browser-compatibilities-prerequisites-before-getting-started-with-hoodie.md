# System Requirements, Browser Compatibilities and Prerequisites

This is a list of everything you should know and prepare *before* finally start coding your app with Hoodie. 


### System Requirements
- Mac OSX
- Windows 7 and up<br />
<small>(Windows 7 on a 64bit machine? <a href="http://faq.hood.ie/#/question/38210291" target="_blank"> You might need this little trick. </a> )</small>
- Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora 19+)


### Browser Compatibilities <small>(all latest stable)</small>

* Firefox (29+)
* Chrome (34+)
* Desktop Safari (7+)
* Internet Explorer 10+
* Opera (21+)
* Android 4.3+
* iOS Safari (7.1+)

Might ask yourself why Hoodie has such high browser requirements? 

This is because we use several browser storages, promises and other things, that require new browsers. We really want to make sure, your application will run smoothly later and you can use all of Hoodies features.
