# Plugins

### Core plugins

Hoodie has a very slim core and can be extended with plugins.
Three plugins are always installed with the core:

- <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/hoodie-plugin-users" target="_blank">hoodie-plugin-users</a>
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/hoodie-plugin-email" target="_blank">hoodie-plugin-email</a>
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/hoodie-plugin-appconfig" target="_blank">hoodie-plugin-appconfig</a>

### Installing plugins
Every hoodie-plugin that has been published on npm can be installed by typing

```bash
$ npm install hoodie-plugin-name
```
in your project's folder.

You can see a full list of plugins <a href="http://plugins.hood.ie/" target="_blank">here</a>.
