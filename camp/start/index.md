# Installing Hoodie on your System

### Prerequisites
For all OS, you'll need <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> installed.
You can download Node from <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a>. We recommend the LTS (Long Term Support) version.

Make sure you have version 4 or higher. You can find out with

```bash
node -v
```

### Installation Done!
Sweet. Now you can find out how to create new Hoodie apps, how the admin interface works, how Hoodie projects are structured, and more in <a href="../start/getting-started/getting-started-1.html">Getting started with Hoodie, part 1</a>.
