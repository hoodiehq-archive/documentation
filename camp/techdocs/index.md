# Hoodie API Guide

The Hoodie Guide is a special version of the API documentation for beginners, intermediates, and advanced programmers who want to have a nicely documented API with additional information and code examples. For now, it covers the core client API.

## 1. The Hoodie Client API

This library, commonly called **hoodie.js**, is what you'll be working with on the client side. It consists of:

- [The Hoodie API](/camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.html), which has a couple of useful helpers
- [The account API](/camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.account.html), which lets you do user authentication, such as signing users up, in and out
- [The store API](/camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.store.html), which provides means to store and retrieve data for each individial user
- [The connectionStatus API](/camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.connection-status.html), which provides helpers for connectivity.
- [The log API](/camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.log.html), which provides a nice API for logging all the things
