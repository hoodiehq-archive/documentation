**version:**      *> 21.0.0*<br>
**source:** 		*[hoodie-account-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-client)*

The account object in the client-side Hoodie API covers all user and authentication-related operations, and enables you to do previously complex operations, such as signing up a new user, with only a few lines of frontend code. Since [data in Hoodie is generally bound to a user](/en/hoodieverse/glossary.html#private-user-store), it makes sense to familiarise yourself with **account** before you move on to [store](/en/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.store.html).

## This is work in progress

Please help us make this awesome <3

For the time being, check out [hoodie-account-clientâ€™s README](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-client).
