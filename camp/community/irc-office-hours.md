# Intro

Dedicated to the Hoodie community members and contributors who sign up for being responsible for the Hoodie IRC Office Hours. These Office Hours are also documented on [the Hoodie Website](http://hood.ie/irc).

## Hi you, great person,

we're happy you're doing the Hoodie IRC Office Hours today!

In order to make this as easy for you as possible, we'd ask you to follow this short guide:

### 1. Mind the time

Hoodie IRC Office Hours take place daily on weekdays from 2-6pm UTC+2. When in doubt about timezones, check <a href="http://everytimezone.com/" target="_blank">this page</a>.

Please keep in mind that not everyone in the channel is on the same time zone, so it usually helps to add the time zone when talking about times and dates. :)

### 2. Getting started – IRC and Twitter

When it's time to start the Office Hours (please start on time), we'd ask you to:

#### 2a) say hi in IRC

Send a short "hi everyone, I'm here now" message in IRC. Here are some sample messages you may want to use or re-write:

- Hi everyone, it's time for our IRC Office Hours! If you have any questions, please ping me. I'm online until 6pm UTC+2.
- Hello folks, good to see you! I'm here for the Hoodie Office Hours from now until 6pm UTC+2. Please ping me if you have any questions, feedback or GIFs you want to let us know about.
- Hi all, we're back with our Hoodie Office Hours! I'm present to support you, if there's anything I can do for you: I'm online for 4 hours starting from now.
- … [your idea goes here]

Oh, yeah, and you may of course add a GIF (not necessarily [this one](http://www.tehcute.com/pics/201204/bunny-falls-asleep-at-desk.jpg)) anytime... (turns out the Hoodie Community loves GIFs).

#### 2b) send a Tweet

Send a short Tweet from the @hoodiehq account or, if you want, your personal Twitter account. If you don't have access to @hoodiehq, just post a Tweet from your account so it can be retweeted from @hoodiehq (yep, we're quick with that). Your Tweet could maybe be something like …

- Time for our IRC Office Hours! We're answering your questions in Freenode #hoodie from 2-6pm UTC+2 today. And we're happy to help!
- It's Hoodie IRC Office Hours again! We're happy to answer your questions or feedback until 6pm UTC+2 today. Find all details here: http://hood.ie/irc
- … [anything else you can think of]

And, yes, the GIF "rule" applies here as well.

### 3. Do it!

- Remember our [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct.html) and *strictly* enforce it.
- Be friendly and patient.
- If you need more than 1-2 minute to answer a question, please let the other party know that you are still there and on it
- If you can't answer a question yourself, please
  - check our [FAQ](http://faq.hood.ie)
  - ask the person who sent it to file an issue in our ["discussions" repo](https://github.com/hoodiehq/discussion/issues/new) or in the [FAQ](https://github.com/hoodiehq/faq/issues/new)
- If you have to leave the channel or pause for any reasons, please take care that someone else can take over the responsibility.

Please try to avoid asking other community members to jump into conversations, unless it's a really urgent case or they have stated otherwise beforehand. You can handle this, and we'll then try everything to resolve the issue posted as soon as we can.

### 4. Remember our FAQ

If you have an interesting question from someone which might be interesting to a broader amount of people, please [post it to our FAQ](https://github.com/hoodiehq/faq/issues/new), ideally including the solution, or just copy-paste it and safe it somewhere so you can add it later. This helps a lot with recurring questions and is a good way to make content accessible to everyone and do support in a sustainable way.

### 5. Say bye on IRC

When Office Hours are over, say goodbye on IRC and leave a message where people can get in touch with us (this is also stated in the IRC channel welcome message, but it's still good to show we're also thinking about this). It could e.g. look like this:

- These were our Office Hours for today. Thanks to all of you for being here today with me, and have a nice evening! If you have questions or feedback later, please check out this page http://hood.ie/irc with all places for filing issues. We'll take care of it then as soon as we can. Thank you!
- Our Office Hours are now over. It was great to chat with you, and I wish you a nice day. See you soon! For those of you who enter this channel later, you can find all places for filing questions, giving feedback of submitting issues here: http://hood.ie/irc Looking forward to hearing from you!
- … [whatever floats your boat]

And … maybe add an [appropriate GIF](http://www.tehcute.com/pics/201204/bunny-falls-asleep-at-desk.jpg). If you want to.


If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask any Hoodie community member anytime.

Thanks for supporting this project!
