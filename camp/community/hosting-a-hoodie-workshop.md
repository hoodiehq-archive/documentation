# Hosting a Hoodie Workshop

*This is a living document and work in progress. If you want to add your feedback or experiences, please [contact us](http://hood.ie/contact).*

## Prerequisites

- How long is the workshop supposed to take? (At least 3-4 hours should be given, depending on the experience levels of the attendees)
- How many participants?
- Who can do the Coaching? (Ideal: have 1 coach per 3-4 participants)
- Which OS?
- Will they bring their Laptops or are computers available? (If the latter, with admin rights for participants?)
- Which experience levels?
  - HTML / CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Terminal
- If possible, arrange “Installation Party” before the actual workshop (Participants can meet and also they know, all is setup. So they will feel more comfortable the next day.)
  - installation guide is [here](../start)
- Set up a Code of Conduct (e.g. similar to [Hoodie's Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct) or [how to design a Code of Conduct](https://adainitiative.org/2014/02/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community/))

## To prepare
- Check if there are enough sockets
- Bring extension cords
- Stable WiFi for everyone. Check if special login for participants is required
- Arrange food and enough drinks & snacks. If you can't do that, make sure to ask the participants to bring some snacks and look up some places you all can eat together.
- Prepare (if necessary) short Hoodie intro talk (see [sample talks](http://hood.ie/contribute#talks) or the [Hoodie Events page](http://hood.ie/events))
- Prepare all important commands on slides or handout.
- If you have more than one person per laptop, please print out the tutorial you are teaching.
- Print the [Hoodie Cheat Sheet](http://hood.ie/dist/presentations/hoodie-cheat-sheet-print.pdf) for each participant
- Prepare all important links as shortlinks
- Prepare typical problems + solutions (also: check FAQ on “Known Errors”) for your coaches
- Prepare a bunch of app ideas (beyond to do list apps) that people can then work on when they know enough about Hoodie, but don’t have a concrete app idea themselves
- Prepare Feedback Form (e.g. like [this one](https://docs.google.com/a/thehoodiefirm.com/forms/d/1toCQfdK4tF2WIXzico5MoMpI_UXpLQ5zvcxFOUhip5M/viewform))
- Check [Hoodie’s FAQ](http://faq.hood.ie) for known bugs and errors – especially
  - [‘npm ERR! Please try running this command again as root/Administrator’](http://faq.hood.ie/#/question/38210259)
  - [common Windows installation problems](http://faq.hood.ie/#/question/48204371)
  - [Error ’could not start Hoodie`](http://faq.hood.ie/#/question/38210193)
