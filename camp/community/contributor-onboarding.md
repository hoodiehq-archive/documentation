## About this document

 > "Being a committer does not mean you commit code, it means you are committed to the project."  
 > – <a href="https://community.apache.org/contributors/" target="_blank">Apache Software Foundation</a>

In this document you will learn about our onboarding process for new people who want to join us in the work on Hoodie.

This document is dedicated to community members. It aims to be a guide for important steps to take and a reminder for how we collaborate in this community.

According to our [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct.html), we are aiming to provide a safe space for everyone in this community. And we're happy to welcome everyone, including developers and people who want to become one of our non-coding contributors.

This document is and will always be work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve our onboarding and community culture and always happy to get feedback!

###  Where and what can people contribute?

Hoodie is a quite big project and we have various parts that need to be created and / or maintained. To find out where we need help, take a look at our [Contribute Site](http://hood.ie/contribute/). If you can't find anything you'd want to do or have further questions, come say hi in [our chat](http://hood.ie/chat/index.html) or [contact us](http://hood.ie/contact/).

---------------

### 1. Say hi!

- As the first and frontmost contact for the new contributor, you are responsible for making them a part of community.
- If this doesn't make sense or is just not possible because of any reason, e.g. your own obligations, lack of time or personal reasons, please talk to the community as early as possible to see who can be their contact person and guide in the next weeks and months.
- Please also keep in mind that, ideally, the two people are sharing the same fields of work, interests or skills so both can learn from each other.
- Once you found someone, give the two an introduction.

Try to speak to the new contributor. We learned that this clears a lot of obstacles in communication and helps getting things going faster. Also, meeting new people is always fun!

The easiest way to do this is a quick <a href="http://talky.io" target="_blank">Talky</a>, Skype call or Google Hangout with the person interested and at least one exisiting contributer (this could be you already). If you happen to be in the same town, meeting for lunch, coffee or going on a walk is always the preferrable option.

### 2. Get Started together

1. Introduce them to our [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/). Please do not just mention it but ask them to read it and ask whether they have questions or concerns. If so, please address them.
2. Find out what their status quo is:
  - what skills do they have?
     - are they developers?
        - frontend / backend / mobile?
     - are they non-coders?
        - what are they specialised in?
  - what are their interests in Hoodie?
  - What do they want to work on?
  - What are their interests regarding personal skills?
  - Is there anything they want to improve at and / or with which we can help them learn?
3. Depending on their skills and knowledge, introduce them to Hoodie-related terms and processes (see [The Hoodie Glossary](../hoodieverse/glossary.html) and [FAQ](http://faq.hood.ie/) for more information).


### 3. Introduce them to the surroundings

Hoodie has various communication channels and workflows that can be quite confusing for people who are new to the community. During this time, your job is to make sure that they know how to effectively communicate with the rest of the community and make sure they are always in the loop.

And, of course: make sure they know they can always contact you with any questions they have. :)

#### The IRC channel
- how to access
  - if not clear: help find a good client (e.g. Textual for Mac or another client you can recommend)
  - also mention Slack access, with invites available [http://hood.ie/chat/index.html](here)
- what to post
- how to ask
- office hours, see [http://hood.ie/irc](IRC page) for details

#### GitHub
- repository strucutre
- how to get access
- how to write good commit messages
- how to file issues
- how / why to submit pull requests

#### Technical topics
- how to read the [documentation](../)
- for developers
   - code review process
   - release process
   - testing process
   - conventions
- for non-coding contributors
   - content review process

#### Our Tools
Hoodie has a few tools and workflows that we created or agreed on using. Your job is to give the new contributor a quick overview of those tools and show how they can use or access them.

- show our [Milestones](http://gr2m.github.io/milestones/)
- show Hoodie [Showcases](http://hood.ie/intro/#showcases)
- show our [Ubersicht](http://espy.github.io/ubersicht/#hoodiehq)

#### Accounts

In order to get started for real, the new contributor of course needs access to the Hoodie software and repositories. Please make sure you only create accounts for the things they need access to in order to get their work done.

 - GitHub

### 4. Define a Workflow

Finally! Our new contributor is all set and ready to get started. You should now work out a frequent feedback loop that fits both your and the contributor's schedule.

- mentoring (who does it? + introduction)
- pairings (with whom, how often and when?)

### 5. Introduce them to the team

Please introduce them to the other team members by sending a quick welcome email and maybe writing a blog post (e.g. a short interview for the ["A Hoodie for you"](http://blog.hood.ie/category/a-hoodie-for-you/) series, for the interview just send them our [Questionnaire Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/144uyYfrX1onnXiWV5wbA3qC_eOoUImolNaMXPdgDWMc/viewform)). Of course not only the team wants to know more about the contributors, but the contributors also want to get to know the team! Maybe you can help by arranging short one-on-ones with other team members.

You should also add them to the the [team section](http://hood.ie/community/#community) of our website and post a tweet about their addition to the team.

**Hooray, the new contributor is now a part of the big Hoodie Family!**

### 6. Stay in touch!

The most difficult job of onboarding is making sure the contributors are always motivated and never left alone, especially when they are having difficulties or problems. You can stay in touch by offering continuous mentoring and pairing (for example once a week or every two weeks, depending on the amount of work they can and want to contribute), and frequent quick chats or emails.

You can also ping them when they're online in IRC or another channel and ask how they're doing. We know many of you are doing this anyway because our community members are amazing, but it's good to keep it in mind. It helps strengthen our relationships and show our appreciation.

### 7. If you need help …

In case this is too much work for you or there are any issues, please bring up these topics immediately. Please check below how and where to talk about them:

- If these are issues which are better not discussed with the group in the first place or if you not sure whether it's appropriate to bring them up in the community, please contact another community member first. This is especially applicable for all personal problems which may occur or topics related with the Code of Conduct. **For the latter, please ask the person who brought up the topic for their consensus to involve another person into addressing the issue first.**
  - [Lena](https://twitter.com/lrnrd) and [Jan](https://twitter.com/janl) are also there to help you anytime.
- If appropriate (see above for clarification), bring the topic(s) up in the community, e.g. by sending an email to everyone or bringing them up in the group chat.

### 8. Improve

After a few weeks you should ask the new Hoodie for feedback on our onboarding process and share their feedback and the insight you received with everyone else. Please also update this document accordingly.


Thanks for your effort! It's great to have you in our community!
