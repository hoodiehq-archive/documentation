# Code a simple time tracker

This tutorial requires plugins, which we had to disable plugins for the Camp Release, but [we are working on bringing them back](https://github.com/gr2m/milestones/issues/89).

But check out our new Demo app which happens to a [tracker application](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker) :) Itâ€™s a great place to dive into a super simple Hoodie Application.
