# System Requirements and Browser Compatibilities

Before you start working with Hoodie, here's what you need to know regarding your development/server environment and the browsers Hoodie will run in.

### System Requirements for Hoodie Server
- Mac OSX
- Windows 7 and up<br />
<small>(Windows 7 on a 64bit machine? <a href="http://faq.hood.ie/#/question/38210291" target="_blank"> You might need this little trick. </a> )</small>
- Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora 19+)

### Browser Compatibilities <small>(all latest stable)</small>

* Firefox (29+)
* Chrome (34+)
* Desktop Safari (7+)
* Internet Explorer 10+
* Opera (21+)
* Android 4.3+
* iOS Safari (7.1+)

**Important**: This list is currently based on [PouchDB's requirements](http://pouchdb.com/learn.html), since Hoodie will be migrating to using that for its in-browser storage soon.
